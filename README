WAusers
=======

WAusers is one component of the WAhelper Web accessibility testing suite (see
http://www.freebsoft.org/wahelper).  WAusers serves for managing Web
accessibility testing sites where users can register, create their own Web
accessibility testing projects and log to all the projects using a single
global password.

Web accessibility testing itself is performed using the WAassistant Web
application from the WAhelper suite.  WAusers is a supplementary Web
application managing WAassistant applications.  Both WAusers and WAassistant
are built on top of the Roundup issue tracking system and their user interfaces
are similar.


* Installation

The following pieces of software are required to run WAusers:

- Roundup 0.8: A flexible issue tracking system available at
  http://roundup.sf.net .

- WAassistant 0.3 or newer: Web accessibility testing management application
  available at http://www.freebsoft.org/wahelper .

After installing the required software, unpack the downloaded WAusers
tarball and copy it to the Roundup trackers directory
(e.g. /var/lib/roundup/trackers/ on Debian systems).  Then follow Roundup
tracker installation instructions to install a WAuser tracker.  In order to be
able to create new projects, a WAassistant tracker template must be available
in one of the standard Roundup tracker directories or in the same directory
where the WAusers tracker is created.


* Documentation

You can find further information about WAusers in its manual.  WAusers manual
is in the doc/ subdirectory.  You can build its Info, PDF and HTML versions by
running `make info', `make pdf' and `make html' commands respectively in the
doc/ subdirectory.
